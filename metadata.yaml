description: "The Federalist (later known as The Federalist Papers) is a collection\
  \ of 85 articles and essays written (under the pseudonym Publius) by Alexander Hamilton,\
  \ James Madison, and John Jay promoting the ratification of the United States Constitution.\
  \ Seventy-seven were published serially in The Independent Journal and The New York\
  \ Packet between October 1787 and August 1788. A compilation of these and eight\
  \ others, called The Federalist; or, The New Constitution, was published in two\
  \ volumes in 1788 by J. and A. McLean. The collection's original title was The Federalist;\
  \ the title The Federalist Papers did not emerge until the 20th century.\nThough\
  \ the authors of The Federalist Papers foremost wished to influence the vote in\
  \ favor of ratifying the Constitution, in Federalist No. 1 they explicitly set that\
  \ debate in broader political terms:\n\nIt has been frequently remarked, that it\
  \ seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and\
  \ example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\
  \ capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or\
  \ whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions,\
  \ on accident and force.\n\nHighlights abound in the essays of The Federalist. Federalist\
  \ No. 10, in which Madison discusses the means of preventing rule by majority faction\
  \ and advocates a large, commercial republic, is generally regarded as the most\
  \ important of the 85 articles from a philosophical perspective; it is complemented\
  \ by Federalist No. 14, in which Madison takes the measure of the United States,\
  \ declares it appropriate for an extended republic, and concludes with a memorable\
  \ defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the Federal Convention.\
  \ In Federalist No. 84, Hamilton makes the case that there is no need to amend the\
  \ Constitution by adding a Bill of Rights, insisting that the various provisions\
  \ in the proposed Constitution protecting liberty amount to a \"bill of rights\"\
  . Federalist No. 78, also written by Hamilton, lays the groundwork for the doctrine\
  \ of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts.\
  \ Federalist No. 70 presents Hamilton's case for a one-man chief executive. In Federalist\
  \ No. 39, Madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called\
  \ \"Federalism\". In Federalist No. 51, Madison distills arguments for checks and\
  \ balances in an essay often quoted for its justification of government as \"the\
  \ greatest of all reflections on human nature.\"\nAccording to historian Richard\
  \ B. Morris, they are an \"incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic\
  \ in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any\
  \ later American writer.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
